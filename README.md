# OntoEdit

Early brainstorming for a simple ontology editor.
Decisions on title, technologies and whether we will do this at all are not finalized.

## Goals

* GUI for SMOG
* simple and easy to use ontology editor for domain experts without Semantic Web expertise
* define properties
* collaboration
* links between classes

## Technologies

* Docker and Docker Compose
* relational database as backend
* single repo
* programming language?
* database? ORM?
* interface to [SMOG](https://github.com/Onto-Med/SMOG/) or stand alone?

## Intended difference to Web Protégé

* more user friendly GUI
* faster and easier for non-ontologists
* more functionality
* ontology management: organizations, repositories,...
